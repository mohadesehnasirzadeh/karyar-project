# Avada Restaurant

## Project Overview

Avada Restaurant is a restaurant-themed website initially built using the Avada WordPress theme. The task was to recreate and rewrite the entire theme in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases the transition from a WordPress-based theme to a fully responsive, static website using only frontend technologies.
